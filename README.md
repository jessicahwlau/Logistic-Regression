# Logistic Regression
- logistic evaluates the logistic regression model given an array of exemplars and the weight parameters
- logisticNLP computes the negative log likelihood of the input data, and the gradient of the negative log likelihood
- learnLogReg is a template for a gradient descent method, with line search, for minimizing the negative log likelihood of the data
